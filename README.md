# Marketing-Mix-Analysis-and-Customer-Insights

This project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing to a marketing mix dataset, focusing on the four Ps—Product, Price, Place, and Promotion—with an added emphasis on People. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer demographics, spending behaviors, and campaign responses. The analysis includes data cleaning, missing value imputation, feature engineering, and correlation studies, followed by statistical testing of hypotheses such as shopping preferences by age, convenience for parents, and the impact of distribution channels. Visualizations like box plots, histograms, and heatmaps are used to highlight insights on top-performing products, campaign effectiveness, and customer complaint patterns, providing actionable recommendations for marketing strategies
